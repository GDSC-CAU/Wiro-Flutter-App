## Problem Statement

South Korea is confronting a significant problem of lonely death among seniors live alone,
which is expected to worsen due to issues like aging society.

Through Our in-depth research we found that elderly individuals
who live alone are dealing with several issues in their daily lives.

We took 3rd and 11th SDGs to deal with this society problem.

The Wiro App sends two notifications with Mission or CheckList each day, tracking the user's responses to ensure
they are staying in touch with.
If a user fails to communicate with app for certain amount of time,
an SOS message is automatically sent to their family, caregivers, or hospital,
thus preventing potential tragedies.
