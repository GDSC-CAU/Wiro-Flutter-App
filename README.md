## Problem Statement

South Korea is confronting a significant problem of lonely death among seniors live alone,
which is expected to worsen due to issues like aging society.

Through Our in-depth research we found that elderly individuals
who live alone are dealing with several issues in their daily lives.

We took 3rd and 11th SDGs to deal with this society problem.

Overall process of our solution is as follows.

  1. Each user get two notifications each day. One is a Mission, another one is a Checklist.
  2. Users completes the missions or reply to the checklists they received.
  3. If there is no complete/reply sign, or our Deep Learning Algorithm decided that a user is in danger, it automatically sends SOS sign to their family, caregivers, thus preventing potential tragedies.

### Target SDGs

- Goal 3. Good Health and Well-Being
- Goal 11. Sustainable Cities and Communities
